        Hi, I'm Sunny, a newly graduated computer science student.
        I have extensive experience in programming, through uni projects,
        at work and personal projects. I'm also a fast learner, so I can easily
        pick up anything I don't already know.

    <h3>Work Experience</h3>

    <h6>Digital Content Coordinator | Salvation Army Hornsby</h6>
    <p><b>2024 - present</b></p>
    <p>
        In this position, I run a weekly after school coding program, teaching Scratch and Python to primary school children.
        I'm responsible for creating the curriculum and all the teaching resources.
        As well as this, I assist with the running of the centre's social media pages.
    </p>

    <h6>Software Engineer (Intern) | Arista Networks</h6>
    <p><b>29 AUG - 2 DEC 2022</b></p>
    <p>
        I interned as a software engineer at Arista, a computer networking company making equipment for large
        data centres and other business environments. In this position, I had to learn quickly, as I had to
        understand the existing code before I could implement the features I was tasked with. I also resolved a
        previously hidden bug in the existing code that was uncovered by my changes.
    </p>

    <h6>Various Roles | AEC / NSWEC</h6>
    <p><b>Various Times 2021 - 2024</b></p>
    <p>
        I've worked a wide range of roles at elections between 2021 and 2024,
        including early voting issuing officer, declaration vote issuing officer (DVIO),
        office assistant and deputy polling place manager.
        In the issuing officer roles, I gained a lot of customer service
        experience, dealing with voters from a wide range of different backgrounds.
        In the DVIO role, which involves more problem solving, as it handles all the special cases
        where voters cannot be issued a normal vote.
        In the most recent election, I was a deputy manager, responsible for
        supervising a team of about 10 staff, setting up and closing the polling place.
    </p>

    <h6>Software Developer | VidUp</h6>
    <p><b>JAN 2020 - MAY 2022</b></p>
    <p>
        I worked part-time for this startup developing a web-based video editor.
        Our product could turn a script into a video in just a few minutes,
        automatically choosing related media and generating subtitles.
    </p>

    <h6>AV Technician (Volunteer) | Salvation Army Hurstville</h6>
    <p><b>2016 - present</b></p>
    <p>
        I've volunteered as an AV technician at Hurstville since 2016.
        The position involves receiving an order of service from the meeting leader
        each week and turning it into a slideshow. On Sundays, I play this slideshow
        during the service, adjusting the visuals and sound as necessary.
        I've also assisted with various other projects over the years, including video editing.
    </p>

    <h3>Achievements</h3>
    <h6>Grand Finalist | UNSW ProgComp 2019</h6>
    <p>
        My team of 3 was a grand finalist (top 8 out of 181 teams) in ProgComp,
        a high school coding competition organised by UNSW. We worked together to solve a variety of different problems.
        Being able to plan out a solution to the problems on paper was a large part of this competition,
        as each team was limited to one computer only.
    </p>

    <h6>6<sup>th</sup> Place | Zero Robotics 2017</h6>
    <p>
        Worked together with a team from my high school, writing code to solve a problem with a virtual robot.
        In later rounds, we also had to work together with teams from around the world. We progressed all the
        way to the final round, where our code was run onboard the International Space Station.
    </p>

    <h3>Personal Projects</h3>
    <h6>Church Presenter</h6>
    <p>
        I built a program to assist my volunteer work as an AV technician.
        It is a slideshow program like PowerPoint, but only with the features I need.
        A slightly feature limited online version can be found <a href="https://sunnyyan01.github.io/church-presenter">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h6>Website</h6>
    <p>
        In my spare time, I have been working on various small projects, which I put on my <a href="https://sunnyyan01.github.io">website</a>.
        Some are also hosted on my <a href="https://cyan00ffff.neocities.org">secondary website</a>.
